# Macros for setting the status leds on the Voron StealthBurner toolhead (or for any neopixel-type leds).
#
# You will need to configure a neopixel (or other addressable led, such as dotstar). See
# https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#neopixel for configuration details.
#
# CONFIGURATION
#
# Example neopixel configuration:
# [neopixel sb_leds]
# pin: <your pin>
# #   The pin connected to the neopixel. This parameter must be
# #   provided.
# chain_count: 3
# #   The number of Neopixel chips that are "daisy chained" to the
# #   provided pin. The default is 1 (which indicates only a single
# #   Neopixel is connected to the pin).
# color_order: GRBW
# #   Set the pixel order required by the LED hardware. Options are GRB,
# #   RGB, GRBW, or RGBW. The default is GRB.
# initial_RED: 0.0
# initial_GREEN: 0.0
# initial_BLUE: 0.0
# initial_WHITE: 0.0
# #   Sets the initial LED color of the Neopixel. Each value should be
# #   between 0.0 and 1.0. The WHITE option is only available on RGBW
# #   LEDs. The default for each color is 0.#
